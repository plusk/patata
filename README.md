# Patata
Get it? Because like the whole "tomato/tomato" debacle, but it's like "tomato/potato", but that's not even the correct misunderstanding, and now it's in italian, and "pomodoro/patata" is even less of a misunderstanding! Hilarious!

## Installation
1. Grab [the package](https://github.com/sardred/patata/raw/master/package/patata.crx).
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` Chrome.
3. Drag-and-drop the package into the window.

You might need to enable developer mode.
